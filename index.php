            <h2>The Only Gym Journal You Will Ever Need</h2>
            <p>MuscleMax is the future of gym journaling. The app allows you to log workouts by entering the type of exercise and also entering the details of it, this is then stored on the app where you can edit and delete them in the workout log. In order to see a more structured layout of the workouts you can use the structured workout page to see everyday you have exercised and which what you did on those days, you can also search specific dates and exercises so you can track your progress over your journal history. You can also track your progress by uploading progress pictures, once uploading you can view them all on one page with the functionalities to delete any pictures or compare two pictures to see your progress. Finally there is a timer section where you can set timers in between workouts in order to get optimum rest times and avoid you having to switch between apps to do this.</p>
